        <p><span class="first-character sc">F</span>rederick Douglass was born as a slave onto a farm. Separated from a
          young age from his mother, Frederick found himself having to compete for food and survive on the plantation.
          Douglass was frequently sent around and leased out to other people to do jobs and much of his wages went back
          to his master. Douglass found his first oppertunity of freedom as a shipyard worker, having some degree of
          freedom in Baltimore. However Douglass was threatened after he postpooned paying his master's fee and attended
          religious meetings. This single event inspired him to escape, and he would eventually make his way by train
          and boat to New York City.</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">Despite his escape, his peral did not end at New York City. At that time, many slave
          owners would be in New York City looking for, and trying to recapture slaves back to the south. Authorities
          would be paid off and it was still a very dangerous place. Meeting other abolitionist such as David Ruggles in
          New York City, Douglass would finally find some safety.</p>

        <h2>ACTIVISM</h2>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <div class="block">
        <p><span class="first-character sc">D</span>ouglass's early activism started with his participation at the
          Anti-Slavery Society convention, giving a speech that moved the audience greatly. Douglass would be eventually
          recruited into the organization, giving speeches around the country speaking out against slavery. Douglass
          frequently discussed the conditions that he lived in, depicting the harsh environment that slaves experience
          down in the south. Writing his first autobigraphy about his life named "Narrative of the Life of Frederick
          Douglass, an American Slave, Written by Himself", doubts about Douglass's true identity as an ex-slave would
          be cleared. There were doubts before this floating in the air, as Douglass spoke eloquently and didn't talk
          like other ex-slaves did. The autobiography blew up, and Douglass proceeded to do lectures in Europe. However,
          with the publication and the specific places named inside it, Douglass's original owner wanted to bring him
          back to slavery. Douglass was in great danger of being recaptured.</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">After the civil war, Douglass relieved that the new rights given to African Americans
          quickly realized that these rights had to come alongside the right to vote. Douglass would campaign for
          suffrage for both women and African Americans, but would later to shift only to African American men to help
          get better support during reconstruction. This would put him at odds with other suffragists, but he deemed it
          be necessary to get any kind of suffrage to be passed. He hoped that after African American men get the right
          to vote, they would help get more universal suffrage for everyone. During the later years of his life, he
          would be commited to social justice. One of the most prominent aspects of Douglass would be his status as the
          most photographed African American at that time. He would help towards bucking the trend of the classic
          stereotype for African Americans. </p>
