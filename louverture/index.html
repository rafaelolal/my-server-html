            Fran√ßois-Dominique Toussaint Louverture was a Haitian general and the most prominent leader of the Haitian
            Revolution. During his life, Louverture first fought against the French, then for them, and then finally
            against France again for the cause of Haitian independence.

          Louverture was born enslaved on the French colony of Saint-Domingue, now known as Haiti. He was a devout
          Catholic who became a freeman before the revolution and, once freed, identified as a Frenchman for the greater
          part of his life. During his time as a freeman he attempted to climb the highly stratified social ladder on
          the island, combatting racism whilst gaining and losing much wealth while working as a planter, slave owner,
          coachman, muleteer and miller across several plantations. At the start of the Haitian revolution he was nearly
          50 years old and began his military career as a lieutenant to Biassou, an early leader of the 1791 War for
          Freedom in Saint-Domingue. Initially allied with the Spaniards of neighboring Santo Domingo, Louverture
          switched his allegiance to the French when the new Republican government abolished slavery. Louverture
          gradually established control over the whole island and used his political and military influence to gain
          dominance over his rivals.

          Throughout his years in power, he worked to balance the economy and security of Saint-Domingue. Worried about
          the economy, which had stalled, he restored the plantation system using paid labor; negotiated trade
          agreements with the United Kingdom and the United States and maintained a large and well-trained army.
          Although Louverture did not sever ties with France in 1800 after defeating rival leaders among the Haitian
          revolutionary population, he promulgated an autonomous constitution for the colony in 1801 that named him as
          Governor-General for Life, even against Napoleon Bonaparte's wishes.

          In 1802, he was invited to a parley by French Divisional General Jean-Baptiste Brunet, but was arrested upon
          his arrival. He was deported to France and jailed at the Fort de Joux. He died in 1803. Although Louverture
          died before the final and most violent stage of the Haitian Revolution, his achievements set the grounds for
          the Haitian army's final victory. Suffering massive losses in multiple battles at the hands of the Haitian
          army and losing thousands of men to yellow fever, the French capitulated and withdrew permanently from
          Saint-Domingue the very same year. The Haitian Revolution continued under Louverture's lieutenant,
          Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who declared independence on 1 January 1804, thereby establishing the sovereign state
          of Haiti.

            Toussaint L'Ouverture is important to Black History as he was a former slave who rose to become the leader of
            the only successful slave revolt in modern history known as the Haitian Revolution.
