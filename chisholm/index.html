          <h4>
            Shirley Chisholm made history as the first black woman elected to
            Congress in 1968. She started out as a representative for Brooklyn
            in the New York State legislature and specialized in education. When
            getting elected to the U.S. House of Representatives four years
            later, she was originally put into the Agriculture Commitee despite
            representing an urban area. After endless perseverence, Chisholm was
            able to persuade leaders to reassign her to an education committee
            and served seven terms (14 years) in Congress.

            Her actions helped open up opportunities for many future African
            American political figures like President Barack Obama and Senator
            Elizabeth Warren, but wanted to be remembered for "having guts."
