        <ul>
            <li>On June 28, 1969, The Stonewall Inn (a gay bar) was raided by police in the morning, arresting many people</li>
            <li>She and Sylvia went at 2am and saw the Stonewall Riots occurring</li>
            <li>Unsure of her exact role, but she stayed in the front lines</li>
            <li>She led many protests along with Sylvia</li>
            <li>The Stonewall Riots led to progression in LGBTQ+ rights, such as the first Gay Pride Parade in 1970</li>

            <li>They created the STAR House to give a home to these youths</li>

            <li>The police did not investigate further until reopening the case in 2012</li>
            <li>She was loved: hundreds went to her funeral, crowding not only the church but the streets</li>
            <li>New York City commissioned a monument for Marsha and Sylvia in 2019, and in 2020, a waterfront park in Brooklyn was named after Marsha</li>
            <li>There are documentaries such as <em>Pay It No Mind: Marsha P. Johnson</em> about her life</li>
