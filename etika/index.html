				Desmond Daniel Amofah or known as Etika was a African American youtuber <br></br> and streamer. He was born on May 12, 1990 to Owuraku Amofah and Sabrina <br></br>Amofah. Etika content would consist of two parts, his youtube content where <br></br> he tended to produced more news based content on information relating to <br></br> Nintendo IPs and his streaming content where he would either play games or react to <br></br>whatever video or thing he was streaming for the day. His reactions would often be over <br></br> the top with him usually screaming along with another action that would accompany it <br></br>like falling out of his chair or tossing things in his room. His personally could be that <br></br>of a hype man where his excitement with whatever got his attention managed to make <br></br>people who were viewing his excited too. Due to personality and content he had <br></br> managed to gained nearly 1.3 million subscribers and paved the way for other Black <br></br>youtube creators and steamers to gain success on youtube like iShowSpeed and <br></br>CoryxKesnhin. His content managed to also unity people of different backgrounds <br></br> due to how the energy released by him and love for the content he looking at the time <br></br>managed to bring people together to see this man react, play, and laugh to whatever he <br></br> was doing and to bond over these experiences. Unforunately on June 22, 2019 after a long<br></br>with mental illness, Etika took his life, in the days that followed his fans began movements <br></br> to memorialize his life by archving all of his videos, making memorial for him, and ultimately <br></br>making a 40 feet mural of him in Buskwich, Brooklyn which celebrated his life and raised <br></br> awareness to mental health issues.
